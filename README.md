Web Scraping Instructions
test heading
1.Required Libraries
  Before you begin, ensure that you have the necessary libraries installed. You can do this by running the following command in your terminal:

  "pip install requests beautifulsoup4 pandas openpyxl"

2.Exporting Data to Excel
  To export the scraped data into an Excel file, the pandas library will be used to manage the data and save it in Excel format.

3.Customizing the Code for Web Scraping
  Follow these steps to customize the code according to the target  website:

3.1 Set the Target URL: Update the url variable with 
    the website link  you want to scrape. For example:

    "url = 'https://www.reed.co.uk/jobs/it-jobs'"

3.2 Identify Job Titles: To extract job titles,
    you may need to specify  the appropriate HTML class or data attribute. If there is no specific class, you can use a data-element attribute or another relevant attribute associated with the job title.

3.3 Adjust the Page Range: Modify the range in the for
    loop to control  how many pages to scrape. For example, to scrape the first 10 pages:

    python code
    "for page in range(1, 10):
    print(f"Scraping page {page}...")"

3.4 Saving Data to an Excel File: If job data is found, you can 
    save it to an Excel file using the following code:

   python code
   "df = pd.DataFrame(job_data)
   df.to_excel('job_listings.xlsx', index=False)" 


   Summary
   1.Ensure that all required libraries are installed before starting.
   2.Customize the target URL and job title extraction logic as necessary.
   3.Adjust the page range based on your scraping needs.
   4.Use pandas to save the scraped data in Excel format.
